# MoSu-CHARMM

MoSu-CHARMM force field developed and reported in the paper "Predicting Biomolecule Adsorption on MoSâ‚‚ Nanosheets with High Structural Fidelity" https://doi.org/10.1039/D1SC06814H can obtaied here. 
The force field is ready for use. I'll spend a bit more time to write instruction on how to use MoSu-CHARMM.
Basically, MoSu-CHARMM  was developed to be used with GROMACS, and therefore can be used with the command gmx pdb2gmx.
